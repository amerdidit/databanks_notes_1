# Databases 1 notes

## Mission statement

There is nothing spectacular going on here. These are simply the notes that I have taken while studying for my Databases 1 course at the ![Distance University of Hagen](http://www.fernuni-hagen.de/).

The notes are for myself only at the moment, and so they exist only to fill in the gaps of my knowledge as far as this course is concerned. Most of it is about german terminology. The notes are ~~not~~ complete, and I would even argue of low quality if to be used by anyone but myself. 

## Future

I will probably translate the notes to english at some point, and clean them up a little bit. Maybe they will serve some other student at some point some good.
